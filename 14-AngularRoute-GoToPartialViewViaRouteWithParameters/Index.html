    <!-- ng-view acts as our placeholder for the partial html page that is to be rendered
            this is based on our defined routes (ngRouter) in the app's config. 

            When we hit a particular route (as defined in the route config in app.config), there will 
            be an associated template (arbitrary content) or templateURl (partial html) with that route,
            and this it will be that template(url) that will be rendered here in ng-view
            -->

    <!-- 
    AGAIN... the order of this ish really matters!
    1) Always incd angularjs first.
    2) then include and of the extra angular modules you may be using (i.e angular-route)
    3) then your app/appconfig etc.. -->
