<div ng-controller="CountriesVisitedController">
    <!-- 4) We use ng-controller="controllerName" to tell angular what controller we are using
            to get and set the model data. Controllername is the name of the controller defined in your JS 
        also note, the scope of this declaration matters... it needs to be on an element 
        which is the parent or some ancestor of elements/code that will USE the controller + scope properties-->
    <div>
        <p>Number of countries visited: {{ countriesVisited.length }}</p>
        <ul>
            <li ng-repeat="countryVisited in countriesVisited">
                <!-- create a hyperlink here  which we will use to create a dynamic link to the countryDetail View
                    for the selected country. we want to identify the selected country by its name, so we use angular
                {{ countryName }} to resolve the value of the countryname and append to our hyperlink.
            
                then routing (as defined in the routeconfig) will take care of capturing the url param
                and re-routing to the detail view WITH that param-->
                <a ng-href="#/detail/{{countryVisited.name}}"> {{ countryVisited.name }} @ ({{ countryVisited.datevisited }}) </a>
<!-- 
                note: we can use normal href over ng-ref, but read this:

                ..."Using Angular markup like {{hash}} in an href attribute will make the link go to the wrong URL 
                if the user clicks it before Angular has a chance to replace the {{hash}} markup with its value. 
                Until Angular replaces the markup the link will be broken and will most likely return a 404 error. 
                The ngHref directive solves this problem." -->
